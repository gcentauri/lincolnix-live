=== This is an example template ===

It has been created to show you what can be put into a template. To edit it, click the arrow right of "Template" and select the template under "Edit Template".

Templates can contain any formatting or content that is also allowed in normal entries.

Your text can be:

- **bold**
- //italic//
- __underlined__
- --strikethrough--


You can add images to your template:

**Images:** [""/path/to/your/picture"".jpg]

You can link to almost everything:

- **links to files on your computer:** [filename.txt ""/path/to/filename.txt""]
- **links to directories:** [directory name ""/path/to/directory/""]
- **links to websites:** [RedNotebook Homepage ""http://rednotebook.sourceforge.net""]


As you see, **bullet lists** are also available. As always you have to add two empty lines to end a list.

Additionally you can have **titles** and **horizontal lines**:

===Title===

====================

**Macros**:

When a template is inserted, every occurence of "$date$" is converted to the current date. You can set the date format in the preferences.
