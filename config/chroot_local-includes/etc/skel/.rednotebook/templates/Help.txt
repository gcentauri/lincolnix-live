Besides templates for weekdays you can also have arbitrary named templates.
For example you might want to have a template for "Meeting" or "Journey".
All templates must reside in the directory "/home/user/.rednotebook/templates".

To create a new template, just save an ordinary textfile in that directory. You can use your favourite text editing program for that task (e.g. gedit on Linux or the editor on Win).
The name of the newly created file will be the template's title.

You can switch to "Preview" mode and click on the link to get to the [template directory ""/home/user/.rednotebook/templates""].

If you come up with templates that could be useful for other people as well, I would appreciate if you sent me your template file, so others can benefit from it.
