  text: 'Hello! Some example text has been added to help you start and you can erase
    it whenever you like. The example text and more documentation is available under
    "Help" -> "Contents".


    The interface is divided into three parts:


    - **Left**: Navigation with the calendar

    - **Center**: Text for a day

    - **Right**: Annotations to a day



    === Preview ===

    There are two modes in RedNotebook, the __editing__ mode and the __preview__ mode.
    Click on Preview above to see the difference.


    === Annotations ===

    Annotations are notes that can be sorted into categories. For example you could
    create the category "Ideas" and then add today''s ideas to it.


    === Save and Export ===

    Everything you enter will be saved automatically at regular intervals and when
    you exit the program. To avoid data loss you should backup your journal regularly.
    "Backup" in the "Journal" menu saves all your entered data in a zip file. In the
    "Journal" menu you also find the "Export" button. Click on "Export" and export
    your diary to Plain Text, HTML or Latex.


    If you encounter any errors, please drop me a note so I can fix them. Any feedback
    is appreciated.


    Have a nice day!'

  text: "=== Annotations in Categories ===\nAnnotations are notes that can be sorted\
    \ into categories. For example you could create the category \"Ideas\" and then\
    \ add today's ideas to it.\n\n- Ideas\n  - Invent Anti-Hangover-Machine\n- Movies\n\
    \  - Monty Python and the Holy Grail\n\n\nThe name \"Categories\" is a little\
    \ bit confusing. It does not mean that a day is put into a category, but that\
    \ there is additional content on the right, sorted into categories. A category\
    \ will contain several notes distributed over various days.\n\nFor example you\
    \ could want to remember all the movies you watch. Each time you watch a new one,\
    \ add the category \"Movies\" with the entry \"Name of the movie\" to the day.\n\
    \nI’ll give you another example: I like to maintain a list of cool things I have\
    \ done. So if I did a cool thing on some day, I navigate to that day and add the\
    \ category \"Cool Stuff\" with the entry \"Visit the pope\" (Sadly I haven’t done\
    \ that, yet ;-) ). When I have done more cool things on many days, they all have\
    \ a category \"Cool Stuff\" and many different entries. It is possible to export\
    \ only that category and get a list of the cool stuff that happened to me with\
    \ the respective dates.\n\nAdditionally you can select the \"Cool Stuff\" category\
    \ in the word cloud window to get a list of all the cool things.\n\nMaybe a good\
    \ thing to know is the following:\n\"Tags\" is a category, the tagnames are entries\
    \ in the category \"Tags\", distributed over various days.\nSimilarly you can\
    \ have a category \"Movies\" and add it together with the movie's name to every\
    \ day on which you see a new film.\n\nCategory entries can have all of the formatting\
    \ that the main text supports, so e.g. you can add bold text, links or images."

  text: '=== Multiple Entries ===

    You can add multiple entries to one day in two ways:

    - Use two different journals (one named “Work”, the other “Play”)

    - Separate your two entries by different titles (===Work===, ===Play===)

    - Use a horizontal separator line (20 “=”s)



    ====================


    === Work ===

    Here goes the first entry.


    ====================


    === Play ===

    Here comes the entry about the fun stuff.

  text: '=== Todo list ===

    You can also use RedNotebook as a todo list. A big advantage is, that you never
    have to explicitly state the date when you added the todo item, you just add it
    on one day and it remains there until you delete it.


    Here is how it works:

    - On the right click on "New Entry"

    - Fill "Todo" and "Remember the milk" in the fields and hit "OK"

    - Select the categories cloud from the drop down menu on the left

    - Now you can click on "todo" and see all your todo items



    - To tick off a todo item you can strike it out by adding "--" around the item.

    - To mark an item as important, add "**" around it.



    So --Remember the milk-- becomes struck through and **Wash the dishes** becomes
    bold.


    You can see all your todo items at once by clicking "todo" in the category cloud
    on the left. There you can also group your todo items into important and finished
    items by hitting "Entry" at the top of the list.


    It probably sometimes makes sense to add the todo items to the day you want to
    have completed them (deadline day).


    Once you''ve finished an item, you could also change its category name from "Todo"
    to "Done".'
